# Edge Cases and Potential Issues

## Data Type Compatibility
- Column type changes (e.g., TEXT to INTEGER) may cause migration failures
- Data truncation or conversion issues
- NULL value handling in NOT NULL columns

## Constraint Violations
- New UNIQUE constraints may conflict with existing data
- New NOT NULL constraints may fail on existing NULL values
- New FOREIGN KEY constraints may reference non-existent data
- CHECK constraints may be violated by existing data

## Performance and Resource Issues
- Large databases may cause memory issues during migration
- Slow performance for databases with many tables/rows
- Temporary file space requirements
- Network file system considerations

## Schema Dependencies
- Foreign key relationships require specific migration order
- Circular dependencies between tables
- Views, triggers, and custom functions not preserved
- Indexes need to be recreated

## Transaction Safety
- Backup creation and replacement should be atomic
- Rollback mechanism needed if migration fails
- File system permissions and locking issues
- Concurrent access during migration

## Data Integrity
- Partial migration failures (some tables succeed, others fail)
- Data corruption during file copy operations
- Backup file corruption or insufficient space
- Schema version tracking and validation

## SQLite-Specific Issues
- SQLite version compatibility between old and new schemas
- WAL mode and journal file handling
- Virtual tables and extensions
- Custom collations and functions

## User Experience
- Progress reporting for long migrations
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Detailed error reporting and recovery suggestions
- Migration log and audit trail
